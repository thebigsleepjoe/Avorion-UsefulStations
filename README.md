![ModLogo](https://github.com/thebigsleepjoe/Avorion-UsefulStations/blob/main/thumb.png?raw=true)

This is a mod for the game Avorion on Steam. It aims to add greater immersion and usefulness to certain kinds of stations in-game.

Some stations, such as Resource Depots, do serve a purpose in vanilla Avorion, however the usage is extremely limited if you are playing singleplayer.
